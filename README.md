#Nigeria Electricity Gap Analysis

##Overview
This project is a data-driven tool designed to estimate the solar energy requirement of a typical household in Jos, Nigeria, particularly during frequent grid power outages.

## Problem statement 
Frequent power outages in Nigeria force household to rely on generators and alternative energy sources. Many households lack the technical knowledge needed to properly sixe a solar energy sysytem, often resulting in underpowered setups or unneccessary over-investment.

## Motivation
Growing up in Nigeria, Power outage were part of daily life. This project was created to better understand how solar energy can realistically support households during grid failures.

## Objectives 
- Estimate daily household energy consumption based on common Nigerian household appliances
- Calculate the required solar panel capacity
- Provide a simple decision-support tool for household considering solar energy

## Methodology 
- Household electrical appliances were listed with power rating
- Daily usage hours were estimated
- Total energy consumption was calculated in watt-hours
- Solar panel requirements were calculated using average hours in Jos, Nigeria

## Why It Matters 
Thos project demonstrate how data and simple model can be used to explore pratical solution to Nigeria's energy challenges.
