# Addressing Energy Poverty: Solar Solution for Jos, Nigeria #
The problem 
In Jos, Plateau State, grid instability lead to frequent blackouts averaging 12+ hours with others maxing to a whole day or weeks. This project provides a technical framework for household to calculate their transition to renewable energy.
## Aim Of Project
I developed a Python-based calculator that:
1. Analyzes houshold "Energy Gaps" during grid failures.
2. Calculates solar hardware requirement based on local Jos solar irradiance levels.

## Connection to IE University
This project reflects my commitment to Social Innovation and Sustainability-core value of IE University. It demonstrate my ability to apply technology to solve real world infastructure challenges in my community.
