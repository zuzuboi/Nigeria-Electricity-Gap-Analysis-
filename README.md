#Solar Energy Requirement Calculator for Households in Jos, Nigeria 
##Overview 
This project is a data-driven tool designed to estimate the solar energy requirements of a typical household in Jos, Nigeria, particularly during period of grid power outages.

## Problem statement 
Frequent power outages in Nigeria force households to reply on alternative ebergy sources. However, many households lack the technical knowledge to properly size a solar ebergy system, leading to under- or over- investment.

##Objective 
The objective of this project is to:
- Estimate daily household energy consumption
- Calculate required solar panel capacity
- Provide a simple decision-support tool for household

##Methodoly
- Household electrical appliances were listed with their power ratings
- Daily usage hours were estimated
- Total energy consumption was calculated in watt- hour
- Solar panel requirements were estimated based on averag sunlight hours in Jos

##Tools and Technologies 
- Python
- Basic data analysis
- GitHub for version control

## How to Run the Project 
1. CLone the repository
2. Navigate to the 'src' folder
3. Run 'solar_calculator.py'

   ## Location Focus
   Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria
